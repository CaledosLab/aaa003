## Commands

### Area Management

#### Create Area
Create a new area with center coordinates and diameter:

```bash
dotnet run -- area create <name> --center <latitude,longitude> --diameter <meters> --displayname <display_name> [--developer] [--noisochrone]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<name>`: Name of the area (required)
- `--center`: Center coordinates as 'latitude,longitude' (required)
- `--diameter`: Diameter in meters (required)
- `--displayname`: Display name for the area (required)
- `--developer`: Developer mode - limit to first 3 railway stations and 3 tram stops (optional)
- `--noisochrone`: Skip isochrone generation when creating the area (optional)

**Isochrone Generation:**
When creating an area (unless `--noisochrone` is specified), the system will:
1. Generate individual isochrones for each station (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes)
2. Create area-wide isochrones by computing the union of all station isochrones for each duration
3. Save area-wide isochrones to `/isochrone/{areaid}/{duration}min.json`

The area-wide isochrones represent the combined accessibility area from all transit stations in the area, handling overlaps correctly using geometric union operations.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create an area centered in Rome with 1km diameter
dotnet run -- area create "rome-center" --center "41.9028,12.4964" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Rome City Center"

# Create an area at equator with 500m diameter in developer mode
dotnet run -- area create "equator-point" --center "0,0" --diameter 500 --displayname "Equator Reference Point" --developer

# Create an area with debug logging and developer mode
dotnet run -- area create "test" --center "40,40" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Test Area" --developer --logging Debug

# Create an area without generating isochrones
dotnet run -- area create "stations-only" --center "41.9028,12.4964" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Stations Only" --noisochrone
```

#### Delete Area
Delete an existing area and all its related data:

```bash
dotnet run -- area delete <name>
```

**What gets deleted:**
- The area entity from Azure Table Storage
- All stations associated with the area
- All isochrone files for the area from Azure Blob Storage

**Parameters:**
- `<name>`: Name of the area to delete (required)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Delete the Rome area and all its data
dotnet run -- area delete "rome-center"

# Delete with detailed logging
dotnet run -- area delete "rome-center" --logging Information
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
üóëÔ∏è Deleting area 'test-area' and all related data...
  üóëÔ∏è Deleting stations for area 'test-area'...
  ‚úì Deleted 15 stations
  üóëÔ∏è Deleting isochrone data for area 'test-area'...
  ‚úì Deleted 75 isochrone files
‚úì Deleted area entity 'test-area'
‚úì Area 'test-area' and all related data deleted successfully!
```

**Important Notes:**
- This operation is **irreversible** - all data associated with the area will be permanently deleted
- If the area doesn't exist, the command will display an error and exit
- Partial failures (e.g., unable to delete some isochrone files) will be logged but won't prevent the overall deletion

#### List Areas
List all existing areas with their station counts:

```bash
dotnet run -- area list
```

**Output Format:**
Each area is displayed on a single line with the format: `<area-id> <area-name> <station-count>`

**Examples:**
```bash
# List all areas
dotnet run -- area list

# List all areas with detailed logging
dotnet run -- area list --logging Information
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
üìç Found 3 area(s):

milan Milano Dev 6
naples Napoli 146
rome Roma 321
```

**Output Details:**
- **area-id**: The unique identifier used internally (row key in storage)
- **area-name**: The display name of the area
- **station-count**: Number of stations stored for this area

If no areas exist, the command will display:
```bash
üìù No areas found
```

#### Area Cleanup Behavior

When creating an area that already exists, the application automatically:

1. **Cleans up existing isochrone data**: Deletes all isochrone files from Azure Blob Storage for the area
2. **Removes existing station data**: Clears all station records from Azure Table Storage
3. **Regenerates everything**: Creates fresh station and isochrone data

**Console Output for Existing Area:**
```bash
üóëÔ∏è Cleaning up 20 existing isochrone files for area 'rome-center'...
‚úì Cleaned up 20 isochrone files
üóëÔ∏è Removing existing stations for area 'rome-center'...
‚úì Removed 15 existing stations
üîç Retrieving railway stations within 5000m...
‚úì Retrieved and stored 15 stations with isochrone data
```

This ensures data consistency and prevents accumulation of outdated isochrone polygons.



### Station Management

#### List Stations
List all stations for a specific area:

```bash
dotnet run -- station list <areaid> [--filter <text>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<areaid>`: The area ID to list stations for (required)
- `--filter <text>`: Filter stations by rowkey or name containing the specified text (optional)

**Output Format:**
```
Name: <areaid>
[Filter: <filter>]
RowKey, Name, RailwayType, WikipediaLink, ABCDE
```

Where ABCDE represents isochrone availability:
- A = 5-minute isochrone
- B = 10-minute isochrone  
- C = 15-minute isochrone
- D = 20-minute isochrone
- E = 30-minute isochrone
- `*` = Available, `-` = Not available

**Examples:**
```bash
# List all stations for Rome area
dotnet run -- station list rome

# Filter stations containing "Roma" in name or rowkey
dotnet run -- station list rome --filter Roma

# Filter stations containing "30" in rowkey
dotnet run -- station list milan --filter 30
```

#### Generate Station Isochrones
Generate or delete isochrone data for a specific station:

```bash
dotnet run -- station isochrone <areaid> <stationid> [--delete [duration]]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<areaid>`: The area ID containing the station (required)
- `<stationid>`: The station ID to process (required)
- `--delete [duration]`: Delete isochrone(s) instead of generating (optional)
  - Without value: Delete all isochrones (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes)
  - With value: Delete specific duration (5, 10, 15, 20, or 30)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Generate all isochrones for a station
dotnet run -- station isochrone milan 21226369

# Delete all isochrones for a station
dotnet run -- station isochrone milan 21226369 --delete

# Delete only the 10-minute isochrone
dotnet run -- station isochrone milan 21226369 --delete 10

# Delete only the 30-minute isochrone
dotnet run -- station isochrone rome 354964363 --delete 30
```

**What gets generated/deleted:**
- 5-minute walking isochrone
- 10-minute walking isochrone
- 15-minute walking isochrone
- 20-minute walking isochrone
- 30-minute walking isochrone

**Error Handling:**
- Shows error if area doesn't exist
- Shows error if station doesn't exist in the specified area
- Shows error for invalid duration values
- Gracefully handles non-existent isochrone files during deletion

### Global Options

All commands support the following options:

- `-l, --logging <level>`: Set the minimum log level (Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None). Default: None
- `--developer`: Developer mode for create area command - limits station retrieval to first 3 railway stations and 3 tram stops

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create area with debug logging
dotnet run -- area create "test" --center "40,40" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Test Area" --logging Debug

# Create area in developer mode with limited stations
dotnet run -- area create "test" --center "40,40" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Test Area" --developer

# Combine developer mode with logging
dotnet run -- area create "test" --center "40,40" --diameter 1000 --displayname "Test Area" --developer --logging Debug

# Generate data with warning-only logging
dotnet run -- generate --logging Warning
```

## Developer Mode

The `--developer` flag is designed to speed up development and testing by limiting the number of stations retrieved from the Overpass API when creating areas.

### How Developer Mode Works

When the `--developer` flag is used with the `area create` command:

1. **Station Limiting**: Only the first 3 railway stations and 3 tram stops are stored
2. **Faster Processing**: Reduces API response processing time and storage operations  
3. **Development Friendly**: Makes testing with smaller datasets more manageable
4. **Clear Indication**: Console output clearly shows when developer mode is active

### Developer Mode Output

```bash
# Normal mode output
‚úì Retrieved and stored 45 stations with isochrone data

# Developer mode output  
üîß Developer mode: limiting to first 3 railway stations and 3 tram stops
‚úì Retrieved and stored 6 stations with isochrone data
  üîß Developer mode: limited to 3 railway stations and 3 tram stops
```

### When to Use Developer Mode

- **Initial Development**: Testing area creation functionality
- **Configuration Testing**: Verifying Azure Storage and API connections
- **Debugging**: Investigating issues without processing large datasets
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quickly testing different coordinates and parameters

**Note**: Developer mode only affects the `area create` command. Other commands work normally.

## Isochrone Generation

The application automatically generates walking distance isochrone polygons for each station using the MapBox Isochrone API.

### How Isochrone Generation Works

When creating an area, the application:

1. **Retrieves Stations**: Gets railway stations and tram stops from OpenStreetMap via Overpass API
2. **Generates Isochrones**: For each station, calls MapBox Isochrone API to generate walking distance polygons
3. **Multiple Durations**: Creates isochrones for 5-minute and 10-minute walking distances
4. **Stores in Azure**: Saves the GeoJSON polygons to Azure Blob Storage in the "isochrone" container

### Isochrone File Structure

Isochrone files are stored in Azure Blob Storage using this naming convention:

```
Container: isochrone
Path Structure: /{area-id}/{station-id}/{duration}.json

Examples:
- /rome-center/354964363/5min.json    # 5-minute walking isochrone for station 354964363
- /rome-center/354964363/10min.json   # 10-minute walking isochrone for station 354964363
- /rome-center/5216453777/5min.json   # 5-minute walking isochrone for station 5216453777
- /rome-center/5216453777/10min.json  # 10-minute walking isochrone for station 5216453777
```

### Isochrone Data Format

Each isochrone file contains a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with polygon data and styling properties:

```json
{
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[12.495825, 41.9028729], ...]]
      },
      "properties": {
        "contour": 5,
        "metric": "time",
        "unit": "minutes",
        "fill": "#22c55e",
        "stroke": "#22c55e", 
        "fill-opacity": 0.1,
        "stroke-width": 0,
        "railway-type": "station"
      }
    }
  ],
  "type": "FeatureCollection"
}
```

### Isochrone Styling

The application automatically applies styling based on station type and duration:

#### **Colors by Station Type:**
- **Railway Stations** (`railway="station"`): Green (#22c55e)
- **Tram Stops** (`railway="tram_stop"`): Yellow (#eab308)
- **Unknown Types**: Gray (#6b7280)

#### **Styling Properties:**
- **Fill Transparency**: 10% opacity (0.1) for all isochrones
- **Border Width**: 
  - 30-minute duration: 2px border
  - All other durations: No border (0px)
- **Additional Properties**: Includes `railway-type` for identification

#### **Generated Durations:**
The application generates isochrones for multiple walking distances:
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes  
- 15 minutes
- 20 minutes
- 30 minutes

### Isochrone Console Output

During area creation, you'll see progress for each station with styling applied:

```bash
üîç Retrieving railway stations within 1000m of 41.9028, 12.4964...
‚úì Area 'test-area' created successfully!
  üìç Generating isochrone data for station: Repubblica

    ‚úì Saved 15min isochrone to: test-area/354964363/15min.json
    ‚úì Saved 20min isochrone to: test-area/354964363/20min.json
    ‚úì Saved 30min isochrone to: test-area/354964363/30min.json
  üìç Generating isochrone data for station: Termini (tram stop)

    ‚úì Saved 20min isochrone to: test-area/610865305/20min.json
    ‚úì Saved 30min isochrone to: test-area/610865305/30min.json
‚úì Retrieved and stored 4 stations with isochrone data
```

With debug logging enabled, you'll also see styling information:
```bash
dbug: Added styling to isochrone: fill=#22c55e, stroke=#22c55e, opacity=0.1, width=0
dbug: Added styling to isochrone: fill=#eab308, stroke=#eab308, opacity=0.1, width=2
```

### Error Handling

The application gracefully handles isochrone generation errors:

- **Missing MapBox API Key**: Skips isochrone generation with warning
- **API Rate Limits**: Includes delays between API calls
- **Network Issues**: Logs errors but continues processing other stations
- **Invalid Responses**: Validates JSON structure before saving

## Area-Wide Isochrones

### Overview

Area-wide isochrones provide a unified view of transit accessibility across an entire area by combining all individual station isochrones into a single geometric representation.

### Generation Process

1. **Individual Station Isochrones**: First, isochrones are generated for each transit station (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes)
2. **Collection**: All station isochrone files for a specific duration are collected from blob storage
3. **Geometric Union**: NetTopologySuite performs a geometric union operation to combine overlapping polygons
4. **Validation**: The resulting geometry is validated and fixed if necessary using buffer operations
5. **Storage**: The unified polygon is saved as GeoJSON at `/isochrone/{areaid}/{duration}min.json`

### File Structure

```
isochrone/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {areaid}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {stationid1}/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 5min.json    # Individual station isochrone

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10min.json       # Area-wide isochrone
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Technical Implementation

- **Library**: NetTopologySuite for geometric operations
- **Union Algorithm**: CascadedPolygonUnion for optimal performance with multiple polygons
- **Overlap Handling**: Automatic geometric union correctly handles overlapping areas
- **Styling**: Area-wide isochrones use blue color (#3b82f6) with 15% opacity
- **Properties**: GeoJSON includes metadata (type: "area-wide", duration, styling)

### Use Cases

- **Urban Planning**: Visualize combined transit accessibility across a city district
- **Real Estate**: Assess overall transit connectivity for property development
- **Transportation Analysis**: Identify gaps in transit coverage
- **Policy Making**: Evaluate the effectiveness of transit network coverage

## Configuration

### Setup Configuration

1. Copy `generator.config.json.template` to `generator.config.json`
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   - `<your-storage-account-name>`: Your Azure Storage account name
   - `<your-account-key>`: Your Azure Storage account key
   - `<azure-maps-subscription-key>`: Your Azure Maps API key (if using Azure Maps)
   - `<mapbox-subscription-key>`: Your MapBox API token (if using MapBox)
3. Set the `API` field to either `"Azure"` or `"MapBox"` depending on your preferred provider
4. Configure the `GeneratorSettings` section for your metro data:
   - `buildStations`: Enable/disable station generation
   - `distances`: Array of distances in meters for proximity calculations
   - `stations`: Output directory for generated station data
   - `metro`: Array of metro line definition files

### API Provider Configuration

The generator supports two mapping API providers:

**Azure Maps:**
